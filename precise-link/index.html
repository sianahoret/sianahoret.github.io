<h2>Would you like to be able to MAKE A HYPERLINK TO ANY TEXT ON A PAGE?</h2>

<br/>Currently browsers resolve a reference to a specific place of a web page (by a "fragment identifier" in a URL) only if the page contains a corresponding mark (either an anchor tag or an element id/name attribute). However you may want to link to an arbitrary part of a web page.

<br/><br/><b>Here are two very simple bookmarklets allowing you to <u>save or share a link to an arbitrary phrase on a page</u> so that later it will be possible <u>to open the link and to see exactly the referred place shown and selected</u>.</b>

<h3>HOW TO USE</h3>

* Below "precise link" is a URL made with "Make Precise Link" bookmarklet.

<h3>Making a "precise link"</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Now (once and forever) drag and drop <a title="Make a Precise Link to the cusror (selection) position on this page."
  href="javascript:(function()%7Bvar%20txt%3D%22%22%2B(window.getSelection%3Fwindow.getSelection()%3Adocument.getSelection%3Fdocument.getSelection()%3Adocument.selection.createRange().text)%3Btxt%3Dtxt.replace(%2F%5Cr%5Cn%7C%5Cr%7C%5Cn%2Fg%2C%22%20%2C%22)%3Bif(!txt)%7Btxt%3Dalert(%22Select%20the%20text%20you%20want%20to%20refer%20to!%22%2C%22%22)%3Breturn%3B%7Dif(txt!%3Dnull)%7Bprompt(%22The%20link%20is%20ready!%20Copy%20and%20use%20it%3A%22%2C%20document.location%2B%22%23href-to-text%3D%22%2BencodeURIComponent(txt))%3B%7D%7D)()" style="grab">Make Precise Link</a> bookmarket into bookmarks in your browser.</li>
  <li>On any web page when want to link to some text, select the text. The text should be as possible unique in the scope of the page.</li>
  <li>Click "Make Precise Link" bookmark created on the step #1.</li>
  <li>A pop-up will appear. Copy the hyperlink there.</li>
  <li>Save or share the hyperlink.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Using a "precise link"</h3>
<ol>
<li>Now (once and forever) drag and drop <a title="Show the place the Precise Link in address bar points to."
href="javascript:(function()%7Bvar%20txt%3Ddocument.location.hash.match(%2Fhref-to-text%3D(.%2B)%2F)%3Bif(txt)%7Bfind(decodeURIComponent(txt%5B1%5D))%3B%7Delse%7Balert(%22There%20is%20no%20Precise%20Link%20in%20the%20page%20address!%22)%7D%7D)();">Resolve Precise Link</a> bookmarklet into bookmarks in your browser.</li>
<li>Visit a web page by a "precise link" (which you have obtained from somebody or saved by yourself earlier).</li>
<li>Click "Resolve Precise Link" bookmark.</li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<h4>Additional notes about a "precise link":</h4>
<ul>
  <li>It is the target page (where "Make Precise Link" bookmark was applied to) URL appended with an additional hash-parameter (#href-to-text=thetext)</li>
  <li>It does not affect the shown page content and behaviour anyway</li>
  <li>When you visit the target page by a "precise link" and a browser does not have "Resolve PreciseLink" bookmark (or you do not click the bookmark), thepage will be shown exactly as if it was visited by its original URL.</li>
  <li>it is not processed by any additional web service</li>
</ul>

<h4>Alternatives</h4>
In the past <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier#Proposals">a few proposals and experimental solutions of the problem were raised.</a>, but even those that were implemented at least aren't cross-browser, also some of them are not working now.
