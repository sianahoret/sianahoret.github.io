<h3>Would you like to be able to MAKE A HYPERLINK TO ANY TEXT ON A PAGE?</h3>

<br/>Currently browsers resolve a reference to a specific place of a web page (by a "fragment identifier" in an URI) only if the page contains a corresponding mark (either an anchor tag or an element id/name attribute). However you may want to link to an arbitrary part of a web page.

<br/><br/><b>Here are two very simple bookmarklets allowing you to <u>save or share a link to an arbitrary phrase on a page</u> so that later it will be possible <u>to open the link and to see exactly the referred place shown and selected</u>.</b> The bookmarklets are true unobtrusive (they don't affect existing page content and functionality anyway).

<br/><br/>
With <a title="Make a Precise Link to the cusror (selection) position on this page."
href="javascript:(function()%7Bvar%20txt%3D%22%22%2B(window.getSelection%3Fwindow.getSelection()%3Adocument.getSelection%3Fdocument.getSelection()%3Adocument.selection.createRange().text)%3Btxt%3Dtxt.replace(%2F%5Cr%5Cn%7C%5Cr%7C%5Cn%2Fg%2C%22%20%2C%22)%3Bif(!txt)%7Btxt%3Dalert(%22Select%20the%20text%20you%20want%20to%20refer%20to!%22%2C%22%22)%3Breturn%3B%7Dif(txt!%3Dnull)%7Bprompt(%22The%20link%20is%20ready!%20Copy%20and%20use%20it%3A%22%2C%20document.location%2B%22%23href-to-text%3D%22%2BencodeURIComponent(txt))%3B%7D%7D)()" style="grab">Make Precise Link</a>
bookmarket (drag and drop it now into bookmarks in your browser) you can visit any site, select some text (the text should be as possible unique in the scope of the page), click "Make Precise Link" bookmark, copy the hyperlink from the appeared pop-up, save or share the hyperlink.

<br/><br/>
With <a title="Show the place the Precise Link in address bar points to."
href="javascript:(function()%7Bvar%20txt%3Ddocument.location.hash.match(%2Fhref-to-text%3D(.%2B)%2F)%3Bif(txt)%7Bfind(decodeURIComponent(txt%5B1%5D))%3B%7Delse%7Balert(%22There%20is%20no%20Precise%20Link%20in%20the%20page%20address!%22)%7D%7D)();">Resolve Precise Link</a>
bookmarklet (drag and drop it now into bookmarks in your browser), when you follow a link made with "Make Precise Link" bookmarklet, you can click "Resolve Precise Link" bookmark - the referred text will be selected and the page will scroll (if necessary) so that the text become visible.

<hr/>

<br/>In the past there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier#Proposals">a few proposals and experimental solutions regarding the problem</a>, but even those that were implemented at least aren't cross-browser, also some of them are not working now.
